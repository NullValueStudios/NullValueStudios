        <h2>Summary</h2>
        I am a life long IT technician and programmer, starting from the age of 5 when I got my first computer, the Commodore VIC-20. Since then, everything computer related has been part of my day to day life. From learning what new leaps hardware has taken, to learning how to program my own video games, if it deals with a computer it's something I want to learn more about.
